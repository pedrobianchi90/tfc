### TFC

## Context
This project was a study object for me, where I was able to improve my software development skills and deepen my knowledge in some technologies. The objective of this project was to build a backend for a previously available frontend, which consisted of an informative website about football matches and classification of teams. My responsibility was to develop the backend part, which allowed the availability of match and classification information through a REST API.

To build this project, I used Node.js as a development platform and the Express framework to create the REST API. I used MySQL database to store the match and classification information, and Sequelize ORM to facilitate access to data. Additionally, I used Docker Compose to understand the configuration of the development environment and facilitate the installation of necessary dependencies.

This project was very important for my growth as a software developer, as I was able to apply various concepts and techniques that I learned throughout my learning process.
